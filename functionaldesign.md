# Functional Design: Asynchronous Optimization

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to optimize the RAT (Retrieval Augmented Thinking) system by improving its asynchronous and parallel execution capabilities. The goal is to maximize throughput and efficiency while maintaining system stability and respecting API rate limits.

## Current System Analysis
### Bottlenecks
1. Sequential decision execution in orchestration
2. Overly restrictive rate limiting
3. Inefficient I/O handling with mixed blocking/async calls

### Impact
- Reduced throughput due to unnecessary sequential processing
- Underutilization of available API capacity
- Suboptimal resource usage due to thread-based I/O

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Orchestration Layer Optimization
#### Requirements
- Batch processing of decisions
- Concurrent execution using asyncio.gather()
- Proper error handling for parallel execution
- Maintenance of execution order where necessary

#### Technical Approach
- Modify ResearchOrchestrator to collect and batch decisions
- Implement parallel execution with proper context management
- Add robust error handling for concurrent tasks
- Maintain metrics for parallel execution

### 2. Rate Limiting Improvements
#### Requirements
- Allow concurrent API calls up to rate limit
- Prevent API throttling
- Maintain accurate request tracking
- Support different rate limits per API

#### Technical Approach
- Replace locks with semaphores
- Implement token bucket algorithm
- Add per-API rate limit tracking
- Provide configurable rate limit settings

### 3. I/O Optimization
#### Requirements
- Native async HTTP client implementation
- Consistent timeout handling
- Connection pooling
- Proper resource cleanup

#### Technical Approach
- Replace requests/aiohttp with httpx.AsyncClient
- Implement connection pooling
- Add proper error handling
- Ensure resource cleanup with context managers

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Orchestration Layer
1. Refactor ResearchOrchestrator
2. Implement parallel decision execution
3. Add error handling and metrics
4. Test concurrent execution

### Phase 2: Rate Limiting
1. Implement token bucket algorithm
2. Replace locks with semaphores
3. Add per-API rate limiting
4. Test rate limit effectiveness

### Phase 3: I/O Optimization
1. Integrate httpx.AsyncClient
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Add proper resource management
4. Test I/O performance

## Success Metrics
- Reduced total execution time
- Increased throughput (decisions/second)
- Maintained API compliance
- Reduced resource usage

## Future Improvements (TODOs)
- [ ] Add dynamic rate limit adjustment based on API response
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for API calls
- [ ] Add detailed performance monitoring
- [ ] Consider implementing backpressure mechanisms

## Technical Decisions
1. Use httpx over aiohttp for better async support
2. Implement token bucket over leaky bucket for rate limiting
3. Use semaphores over locks for concurrency control
4. Maintain backwards compatibility during refactor

## Dependencies
- httpx for async HTTP
- asyncio for concurrency
- Optional monitoring tools (TBD)

## Security Considerations
- Proper API key management
- Rate limit enforcement
- Error handling for sensitive data
- Resource cleanup
