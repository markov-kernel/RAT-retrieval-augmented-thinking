# Research Report: python -m rat.rat_research

## Executive Summary

The query "python -m rat.rat_research" appears to be a command to run a Python module related to RAT (Remote Access Trojan) research. However, I don't have specific information about a module with that exact name. Instead, I can provide some relevant information about Python-based RATs and research in this area:

Python has been used to develop various Remote Access Trojans (RATs) for cybersecurity research and malicious purposes. Some recent findings include:

1. A Python-based RAT called "PY#RATION" was discovered in the wild. This malware exhibits remote access trojan behavior, allowing for control and persistence on affected hosts. It uses websockets for command and control communication and data exfiltration [Source: https://www.securonix.com/blog/security-advisory-python-based-pyration-attack-campaign/].

2. Researchers identified a campaign using poisoned Python packages to deliver Linux and macOS backdoors. The malware, named PondRAT, is believed to be a lighter version of another RAT called POOLRAT, both attributed to a threat actor known as Gleaming Pisces [Source: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/gleaming-pisces-applejeus-poolrat-and-pondrat/].

3. A fully featured information stealer and RAT called "Colour-Blind" was found in the Python Package Index (PyPI). This discovery highlights the need for enhanced monitoring of package repositories to detect malicious code [Source: https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/pypi-packages-deliver-python-remote-access-tools].

4. The Evilnum group, known for targeting financial technology companies, developed a Python-based RAT called PyVil. This malware can exfiltrate data, perform keylogging, take screenshots, and deploy additional credential-harvesting tools [Source: https://threatpost.com/python-spy-rat-target-fintech/158934/].

When conducting research on RATs, it's crucial to use secure environments and follow ethical guidelines. Many cybersecurity professionals use tools like RAT-STATS, a free statistical software package, for legitimate claims review and analysis [Source: https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/].
