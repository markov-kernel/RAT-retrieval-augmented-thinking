## Introduction

Belgium’s upcoming e-invoicing mandate requires businesses to transition from traditional paper-based or PDF invoicing to structured digital formats (XML/UBL) distributed via networks such as Peppol. This regulation aims to improve invoice processing, tax compliance, and data transparency. For SMEs, selecting software that can navigate these requirements efficiently is critical. In this paper, we analyze the current market offerings and provide a comprehensive overview of key solutions specifically tailored for Belgian SMEs.
